# Dice Games

The goal of `Dice Games` is to provide a beginner friendly framework for approaching problems and turning them into code. You can think of this course as a dedication to the study of human mechanisms and their replacement by mechanical or electronic systems.

It‚Äôs about bringing the concept of physical dice and converting into problems that can be solved and writing code that builds foundations up to a small functional application.

By using an imaginary (or real!) pair of dice, we are going to use this course to consider how you can take these concepts and apply them into a functional program.

## Questions to ask

Before starting this course, you should stop and consider the following:

- [ ] Why am I starting this learning journey and what do I hope to gain out of it?
- [ ] How will I be able to apply this knowledge in my future life, job, and projects?

### My own answers

While it's important for you to understand your own reasons and goals you are looking to gain out of this experieence, it's just as important to understand what my goals as a teacher and transmitter of this information are.

- [x] Why am I starting this learning journey and what do I hope to gain out of it?
  - **_Creative Commons_** - My wish is to provide a public work of art that can be used by anyone and adapted as seen fit for the times using the dual CC0 and MIT licenses.
  - **_Dice_** - Dice where the first thing I learned to think about in approaching problems. While there is apparent simplicity in their existance, it teaches one to think of them in entirely new ways.
  - **_Approach_** - I feel these methodologies will serve you as a student and lay groundwork for future teachers and students.
- [x] How will I be able to apply this knowledge in my future life, job, and projects?
  - **_Learning_** - I have a love for learning and I want to help others find that spark within themselves. It's important to understand that you will only gain what you put into these courses (including me as a teacher), it's completely up to you how you use them.
  - **_Understanding_** - One should _never_ stop learning new things and gaining understanding of the world around us. We can only apply theory to things we have studied and understand. I myself am using these courses as an opprotunity to learn how to teach others in meaningful ways.
  - **_Relief_** When seeking answers in life and finding truth, it's like taking a drink of ice cold water in a hot desert. If I can help even one person, then this effort was woth it. Approach every problem in your life with üíú and you can never go wrong!
  - **_Freedom_** - All information contained within these documents are my own thoughts, teachings, examples, and solutions. I want to share this with anyone that wants to better themselves. Knowlegde and health should not be behind a paywall and I create this work in dedication to helping all beings.
